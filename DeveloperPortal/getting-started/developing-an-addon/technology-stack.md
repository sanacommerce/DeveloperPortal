## Training Material

Before starting the tutorial on how to create an Add-on for Sana Commerce, be sure to familiarize yourself with the technologies required.

If you already have access to our [Sana Community](https://community.sana-commerce.com), you can make use of our [Sana Commerce Cloud - SDK Training Material](https://community.sana-commerce.com/SanaCommerceCloudForImplementationPartners/Customization/SDKTrainingMaterial.aspx) which contains in-depth knowledge of the technologies used. Although these videos are aimed at SDK Customization, only the last video (GraphQL - Part 2) is not relevant to Add-on development. These videos are complimentary for all Sana Partners.
