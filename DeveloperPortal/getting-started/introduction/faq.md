# Frequently Asked Questions

### Why do I need the SDK for developing an Add-on?<br/>Don't you have an ADK Visual Studio solution?

Stricly speaking, you don't need the SDK per se to build an Add-on. But it makes it a lot easier to be able to run and debug your Add-on directly from the SDK solution.

We're still in the process of converting both our client applications (Web store & Admin) from JavaScript to TypeScript. After that process is completed, we will consider the possibility of releasing an independent ADK Visual Studio solution.

### Can we publish our add-on(s) to your App Store?

If you are an **ISV Partner** building an Integration add-on, please contact our Product Manager ISV partners, Frank de Roon at f.deroon `at` sana-commerce.com.

If you are an **Implementation Partner**, see our article on [Deployment](../develop-an-addon/deployment.md) for deploying your add-on for your customer(s). At this point in time, our App Store is still closed off to custom Add-ons.

### How can we monetize our add-on(s)?

At this point in time, there is no system in place through which customers can be billed automatically when using your add-on.
