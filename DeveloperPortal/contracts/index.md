# Sana's Contracts

The promise of Sana Commerce Cloud's SaaS offering is that customers will continue to receive continuous updates on the Core Framework while Add-ons will remain working without adjustments. In order to achieve this, Add-ons must be able to rely on the Core Framework's backward-compatibility with Add-ons that were developed for an older Sana Commerce Cloud version.

This section of the website covers all contracts that Sana has promised to keep stable for as much as possible, as long as possible. Some of these contracts, like the GraphAPIs, can be used outside the scope of Sana Add-ons as well. <!--See the _Advanced Scenarios_ in the [Customize](../customize/index.md) section.-->
