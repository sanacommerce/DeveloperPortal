# eBusiness Connector

The eBusiness Connector is Sana's proprietary contract between the Sana Commerce Framework and the ERP.

Its [reference documentation](https://community.sana-commerce.com/docs/eBusiness/index.html) is only available to Sana Partners on our Sana Community.

> [!NOTE]
> The reference documentation still needs to be updated to Sana Commerce Cloud. However, breaking changes were deliberately avoided to smoothen the transition for customers coming from Sana Commerce 9.3.5.
> <br/><br/>You can read more about this backward-compatibility [here on our Online Help website](https://support.sana-commerce.com/Content/Transition-Guide/ERP-Connectors.htm).
