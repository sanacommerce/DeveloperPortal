# Integrate 3rd party solutions into Sana

> [!NOTE]
> If you want to know more about general information on how to develop an Add-on, go to our [Developing an Add-on](/getting-started/developing-an-addon/technology-stack.html) section.

The target audience for this section consists of:
 - **Sana ISV Partners**
   <br/>Looking to integrate their solution into Sana Commerce
 - **Sana Implementation Partners**
   <br/>Looking to build their own Add-on for an integration _or_ customize one of our existing integration Add-ons.

## Viability

In order for a 3<sup>rd</sup> pary solution to be integrated into Sana, Sana must already be familiar with said solution's concept. Integrations are all about the finer grained specifics.

In the navigation on the left, you'll see the list of concepts that Sana already exposes for Add-ons to hook into. Nevertheless, some integration scenarios require a different level of integration than others. So be sure to dive deeper into the details before concluding the viability of your use case.

> [!TIP]
> Keep in mind that you are also not restricted to using only the Extension Points mentioned under each concept. Any Add-on, regardless of whether it implements a specific Integration concept or not, can utilize any and all of the available [Extension Points](../contracts/extensions/index.md). In some cases, creative out-of-the-box thinking can go a long way in finding a solution within the boundaries of constraints.
